            <ul>
                <div class="list1">
                    <li>8 oz (225g) linguine pasta</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 pound (450g) raw shrimp <em>buy frozen, peeled, and deveined shrimp</em></li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Old bay seasoning</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic <em>minced</em></li>
                    <li>1/2 cup heavy cream <em>(double cream in the UK)</em></li>
                    <li>1/2 cup parmesan <em>grated</em></li>
                    <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley <em>chopped</em></li>
                </div>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <div class="list2">
                    <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, boil water and salt it. Add your pasta, and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. When the pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta.</li>
                    <li>In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter, and add olive oil. Cook the shrimp for a minute, then season with salt, pepper, and Old Bay Seasoning or paprika if using.</li>
                    <li>Continue to cook the shrimp until it's pink. Do this in batches if you're worried that you may overcook the shrimp. Remove the shrimp onto a plate and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In the same pan, melt butter and add garlic, cook for 30 seconds or until it's fragrant. Add the heavy cream, and with the spatula deglaze the pan.</li>
                    <li>Add parmesan, let it melt then loosen the sauce with reserved pasta water and allow to simmer for a minute. Taste the sauce and see if more salt and pepper is needed.</li>
                    <li>Toss the pasta with the sauce until it's well coated. Add the shrimp back in to reheat it gently, garnish with freshly chopped parsley and serve.</li>
                </div>
            </ol>
        <h3 class="notes">Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <div class="list3">
                    <li>If you cook the shrimp from frozen, you will have liquid coming out and that's fine as it will take about a minute to simmer it down (not enough to overcook the shrimp). If possible, thaw the shrimp before cooking.</li>
                    <li>Don't forget to reserve about a cup of the pasta cooking water, it's quite starchy and great for loosening up the sauce. You will most probably need much less than a cup, but to stay on the safe side I always reserve 1 cup and drain the rest.</li>
                    <li>his pasta makes 4 normal servings, or 3 big ones.</li>
                    <li>Store in the fridge in a sealed container for up to 3 days.</li>
                    <li>Reheat the pasta in a skillet over low-medium heat, and add a splash of water to loosen the sauce. Do the same if using the microwave. I don't recommend freezing this creamy shrimp pasta.</li>
