# odin-recipes
Create a basic website using HTML to link to some recipes. The skills needed in HTML to complete this project will include: using the proper elements including open and close tags with their contents, putting the elements in the proper locations and nesting them when needed to create Parent - Child and Sibling relationships, using attributes of the elements when needed (such as lang="en", charset="utf-8", src="link to an image here", and href="link to a webpage here"), and using tags to bold and italicize words on the page when they should be recognized as important.
